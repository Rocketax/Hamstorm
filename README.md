# Hamstorm
Repository to showcase the source code from Hamst√∂rm on steam.

You can play the game here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2944680/Hamstrm/

The source code is taken from an Unreal Engine 5.1 project.
This project was initially on P4V, I only transfered the source code.
I worked on this project alongside another programmer as well as a team of artists.
Since there were two of us (programmers), I worked on basically every functionality.
